# RawImageBatchLab

A minimal GUI application for applying common RAW photo adjustments and batch processing files.

This project is currently a work in progress. It features a Tkinter-based interface for tweaking exposure, contrast and other controls with a live preview, and a small processing pipeline built on `rawpy` and `OpenCV`.
